h3. General TODOs

* Railshoster::InitCommand - Check wether it is possible to replace "system" call with a pure ruby version possibly by using the capistrano gem directly via ruby.
* Test bin/railshoster
* railshoster deploy should check capistrano's exit status and respond to that in case of a failure.
