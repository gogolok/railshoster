h2. 0.0.1

* Prepare a deployment for a RailsHoster shared hosting.
* Be prepared to at RailsHoster vps deployments later.

h2. 1.0.0

* Solve database.yml issue - mysql or mysql2. Decide using bundler?

h3. Product Backlog

* Mailer-Configuration
* Multistage Deployments - Deploy an app to a shared hosting (e.g. dev) and to a VPS (production).

h3. General TODOs

* Railshoster::InitCommand - Check wether it is possible to replace "system" call with a pure ruby version possibly by using the capistrano gem directly via ruby. See branch "run_cap_task_from_ruby-2011-11-08" for a try on how to do it.
* Test bin/railshoster
* railshoster deploy should check capistrano's exit status and respond to that in case of a failure.
